# Shop-with-Maya-2.0
# Problem Statement
As young shoppers, we often face uncertainty when ordering clothing online, questioning whether a piece will suit our body type. Frequently, we end up with items that do not meet our expectations, leading to dissatisfaction and a lack of confidence in our fashion choices. Moreover, the Gen-Z demographic is constantly on the lookout for trendy, new styles to stay ahead in the fashion game, creating and following trends with their unique choices.
# Solution
Keeping the above problem statement in mind, we present two revolutionizing solutions:         Photo Styling and Trend Identification.
Photo Styling  - This feature allows users to upload full-body images, allowing the platform to analyze their body type. Post this, with the help of Virtual Try-On (VTON) model, we can recommend clothes based on our research of fabrics and styles that look good on different body types, ensuring users receive personalized suggestions that will complement their physique.
Trend Identification - Using data analysis, we aim to create a comprehensive "Trend Book". Based on past user preferences and current fashion trends, this feature will provide customers with personalized insights into their fashion trends and styles. In the future, consumers will be able to share this on social media, allowing their followers to see and promote their fashion choices and trends.
# Flow of the solution -
Upon signing up on the Myntra website, users can upload full-body images to MAYA 2.0, which analyzes their body type using advanced algorithms. This analysis accurately determines the user's physique, laying the foundation for personalized fashion insights. Additionally, users can select their preferred fabric types, such as cotton, jute, or silk.
The platform then employs a Virtual Try-On (VTON) model to simulate how different clothes will look on the user. This technology creates realistic visual representations, allowing users to see potential outfits on their own bodies.
Based on extensive research on fabrics and styles suited to various body types, MAYA 2.0 lets customers visualize how a particular piece of cloth would look on them . These suggestions are designed to complement the user's physique and enhance their appearance.
As users interact with the platform, their fashion preferences and style choices are recorded and analyzed. This data is combined with current fashion trends to offer tailored fashion insights. The culmination of this process is the creation of a comprehensive "Trend Book." This feature provides customers with personalized insights into their fashion trends and styles, reflecting both past preferences and current trends using libraries such as image kit.io.
In the future, users will be able to share their "Trend Book" on social media , allowing followers to view and promote their fashion choices. This social sharing fosters a community of fashion enthusiasts and enhances user engagement with their style.
Our model can be integrated with the already existing Myntra Stylist-MAYA. 
# Future Prospects-
In the future prospects of this project, we intend to make the "trend book" share-able on various social media platform so that others can take inspiration from a set of "trends".
We also intend to include bilingual support for customers who are not so much comfortable with only one language in use.
